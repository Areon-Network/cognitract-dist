# Cognitract
ðŸ“‹ Verify &amp; manage your Smart Contracts on AreonScan directly from your terminal.

## Available Commands
- `verify <isTestnet>` Compiles your Solidity (`.sol`) files and compares it against the bytecode of the deployed smart contract. 
- `rmscolc` Removes all the Solidity compiler binaries __(this does not affect any solc binaries outside Cognitract context)__.

## Usage
Tip: `-t or --testnet` flag was used in order to run it on Areon Testnet. You can simply omit it in order to verify a contract on Areon Mainnet.
